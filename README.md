## 🛠 Data Cleaning Steps

### 1️⃣ Missing Value Treatment
- Age → Median Imputation  
- Embarked → Mode Imputation  
- Cabin → Dropped  

### 2️⃣ Feature Selection
Removed:
- PassengerId  
- Name  
- Ticket  

### 3️⃣ Encoding
Applied One-Hot Encoding for:
- Sex  
- Embarked  

### 4️⃣ Outlier Removal
Used IQR method to eliminate extreme values.

### 5️⃣ Feature Scaling
Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical distributions.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
- Higher fare passengers had better survival probability.
- Majority of passengers were between ages 20–40.
